# InvestEdge
InvestEdge is a quantitative backtesting framework designed to analyze and compare SIP strategies. It focuses on evaluating a "Rotation" strategy against traditional baseline SIPs. The system allows users to simulate portfolio performance using historical NAV data, applying dynamic allocation rules based on multi-horizon returns and risk metrics.
